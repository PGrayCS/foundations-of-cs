## 🧐 About

**Foundations-of-CS** is an open, community-driven primer covering the essential building blocks of computer science. Each chapter is a self-contained module with:

* **Concept Overview**: Clear, beginner-friendly explanations.
* **Code Examples**: Hands-on scripts in Python, JavaScript, and C.
* **Exercises & Solutions**: Thought-provoking problems with step-by-step answers.
* **Visual Aids**: SVG/PNG diagrams to illustrate key ideas.

Ideal for newcomers, students prepping for interviews, and educators seeking ready-made lessons.

## ✨ Features

* **Modular Chapters**: Pick and choose topics by folder.
* **Starter Issues**: Labels (`good first issue`, `help wanted`) for easy on-boarding.
* **CI-Driven Quality**: Markdown linting, spell-check, and test runners via GitHub Actions.
* **Multi-language Support**: Localization-friendly structure for translations.

## 🗂 Chapter Structure

Each topic follows the same template:

```
NN-topic-name/
├── README.md        # Overview & key concepts
├── examples/        # Code snippets demonstrating concepts
│   ├── example1.py
│   └── example2.js
├── exercises.md     # Practice problems
├── solutions.md     # Detailed answers
└── assets/          # Diagrams and visual aids
```

Contributors can add new folders (`03-pointers`, `04-stacks`, etc.) using this layout.
